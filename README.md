# Development Containers

Python and Dotnetcore examples borrowed from Microsoft.
Make sure that you install the Docker, Kubernetes and Remote Container plugins for VS Code.

Then you can have some fun:

- Hit F1 in VS Code
- Type "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container..."
- Select the python or dotnetcore folders
- When the Docker container is built you can hit F5 to start the application
